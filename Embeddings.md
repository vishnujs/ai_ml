### Embeddings

- its making a higher order vectors(that contains a lot of features) into a lower order space.It is sort of like dimentionality reduction.
- the google ai converts a large data set and converts a list on a two dimentional space
	-we have to have more dimentions for actually placing in the embeddings
	- representing the two dimentional we have x axis with adult towards right and children towards left, y axis with blockbuster to the top and arthouse to down
	- similarity is based on how close they are-may be this could be determined by euclidean distance
	- assume user ratings can be described using d aspects
	  - we can represent the in a d-dimention where it fits in a point based on those
	  - Embeddings can be learned from data
	- no seperate training needed
	  - embedding layer is
